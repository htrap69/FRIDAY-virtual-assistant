# FRIDAY-virtual-assistant
FRIDAY is a Virtual Assistant made using Python 3.
---------------
The name has been inspired by one of my favourite movie series from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Iron Man.
So the assistant pretty much does all the basic things you say to it. Such as:

* Introduce itself and Me!
* Opens YouTube
* Opens Google
* Opens Discord
* Performs Google Search
* Tells the time
* Opens VS Code(should be downladed)
* Opens Spotify (should be downloaded)
* Opens PowerShell
* Searches and Speaks Wikipedia Info



Going to add some other functionalities later and will be updating it regularly!
